# geniworld
geniworld contains code related to geni.org and its sequel, a Drupal-based site currently named geni15.wrsc.org
This repository was created by PMD, one of the co-founders of www.geni.org in 1995.

Before the Buckminster Fuller Centennial Celebration in 1995 in San Diego, CA, there was a GENI Board Meeting where one of the Board Members from Boeing presented information about this new, repidly-growing technology, called the World Wide Web. At the time, there were less than 100,000 web sites in the world. It did seem to have a geometric growth curve, and so it was decided to register the domain name: geni.org  and use it to promote the Centennial events.

PMD went to the San Diego Computor Show (this is not a mis-spelling) that year, to learn more about this new thing called a browser, Chameleon. After talking to dozens of people, a young student connected me with the right person who got us started.  

Since that time we have had hundreds of people -- staff and volunteers, work on the site and improve its look and feel.
We are in the rpocess of converting the entire site to Drupal, to help manage the entire process.

As of today, 2017-01-12, there are over 7000 pages of content of various complexity that are a part of this organically growing site, about how to build and maintain a global grid of rewnewable energy.

The GENI.org Drupal site was begun in 2014, back when we thought that it would be an easy and quick transition to Drupal, and ready for launch in 2015.

It is now 2017, and the process continues as we are currently managing over 2000 pages of the original site in Drupal, with another 3/4 of the original content still to be transferred.

P.S. the news of the day today in 2017 in San Diego, the former San Diego Chargers have decided to move back to Los Angeles after 55 years in San Diego, CA. :( :(
