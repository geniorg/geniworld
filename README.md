# geniworld
geniworld contains code ralted to geni.org and its sequel, a Drupal-based site currently named geni15.wrsc.org
This respository was created by PMD, co-founder of www.geni.org in 1995.

Since that time we have had hundreds of people -- staff and volunteers, work on the site and improve its look and feel.
We are in the rpocess of converting the entire site to Drupal, to help manage the entire process.

As of today, 2017-01-12, there areover 7000 pages of content of various complexity that are a part of this organically growing site, about how to build and maintain a global grid of rewnewable energy.

The Drupal site was begun in 2014, back when we thought that it would be an easy and quick transition to Drupal.

It is now 2017, and process continues as we are currently managing over 2000 pages of the original site in Drupal, with another 3/4 of the original content still to be transferred.
